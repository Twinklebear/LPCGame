{"name":"LPCGame","body":"# Working on a C++ tile based 'engine' using SDL\r\n\r\n### Todo:\r\n- Simple map editor\r\n\r\n### Done:\r\n- State's Run() function now returns a string corresponding to the state that should be loaded next, 'quit' specifies that the program should exit completely. ObjectButtons can register a callback SetExit(std::string) for the class's function, which when called will exit Run() and return the desired string as the return code.\r\n- GameObjects now have Save and Load functions, along with States. Save returns a Json::Value containing the information about the object, whereas Load will take a Json::Value and setup the appropriate configuration. I have yet to write load\r\n- States are now loaded from file when needed, saved when they exit, deleted from the statemanager and a new state is loaded, only one state is tracked by the StateManager at a time instead of the vector like before, because they're loaded from file only when they're needed.\r\n- State Manager is looking good, state system seems to be running well\r\n- Image is able to generate uniform clips and can also Load/Save clips to file\r\n- Tile's box, type and solid are now saved and loaded\r\n- Moving camera now implemented\r\n\t- Also can set a width and height for the current scene being drawn, in gamestates it's the map w/h in menu statues it can be specified as desired. The scene will be centered on screen\r\n\t- New math functions available for converting vectors and rects to and from scene space\r\n\t- Would like to test camera on more cases but it seems good.\r\n\t- ISSUE: Resizing window doesn't seem to update the drawing of objects, ie. the scene doesn't recenter which is annoying\r\n\t\t- In addition: Resizing window while playing a gamestate and then trying to quit causes a crash\r\n\t- Also: the scene must be same size or bigger than the camera, checks are in place to make sure of this (I believe?)\r\n\t\t- check again","tagline":"Working on a C++ tile based engine using SDL","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
