<h3>Todo:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Simple map editor</li>
</ul><h3>Done:</h3>

<ul>
<li>State's Run() function now returns a string corresponding to the state that should be loaded next, 'quit' specifies that the program should exit completely. ObjectButtons can register a callback SetExit(std::string) for the class's function, which when called will exit Run() and return the desired string as the return code.</li>
<li>GameObjects now have Save and Load functions, along with States. Save returns a Json::Value containing the information about the object, whereas Load will take a Json::Value and setup the appropriate configuration. I have yet to write load</li>
<li>States are now loaded from file when needed, saved when they exit, deleted from the statemanager and a new state is loaded, only one state is tracked by the StateManager at a time instead of the vector like before, because they're loaded from file only when they're needed.</li>
<li>State Manager is looking good, state system seems to be running well</li>
<li>Image is able to generate uniform clips and can also Load/Save clips to file</li>
<li>Tile's box, type and solid are now saved and loaded</li>
<li>Moving camera now implemented

<ul>
<li>Also can set a width and height for the current scene being drawn, in gamestates it's the map w/h in menu statues it can be specified as desired. The scene will be centered on screen</li>
<li>New math functions available for converting vectors and rects to and from scene space</li>
<li>Would like to test camera on more cases but it seems good.</li>
<li>ISSUE: Resizing window doesn't seem to update the drawing of objects, ie. the scene doesn't recenter which is annoying

<ul>
<li>In addition: Resizing window while playing a gamestate and then trying to quit causes a crash</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also: the scene must be same size or bigger than the camera, checks are in place to make sure of this (I believe?)

<ul>
<li>check again</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
