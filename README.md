# Working on a C++ tile based 'engine' using SDL

### Todo:
- Finish setting up the state machine, I hacked together a rudimentary system however I need to finish setting up the full a nice version with ability to transfer cleanly and many times between states
	- Related to clean transitions between states: states must be able to serialize and load themselves from a configuration file that will give them information about the state's configuration
- Simple map editor
