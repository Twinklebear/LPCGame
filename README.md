# Working on a C++ tile based 'engine' using SDL

### Documentation:
- [Code](http://twinklebear.github.com/LPCGame/)
- [JsonCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/)
- [SDL 2.0](http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/FrontPage)

### Todo:
- Simple map editor

### Done:
- State's Run() function now returns a string corresponding to the state that should be loaded next, 'quit' specifies that the program should exit completely. ObjectButtons can register a callback SetExit(std::string) for the class's function, which when called will exit Run() and return the desired string as the return code.
- GameObjects now have Save and Load functions, along with States. Save returns a Json::Value containing the information about the object, whereas Load will take a Json::Value and setup the appropriate configuration. I have yet to write load
- States are now loaded from file when needed, saved when they exit, deleted from the statemanager and a new state is loaded, only one state is tracked by the StateManager at a time instead of the vector like before, because they're loaded from file only when they're needed.
- State Manager is looking good, state system seems to be running well
- Image is able to generate uniform clips and can also Load/Save clips to file
- Tile's box, type and solid are now saved and loaded
- Moving camera now implemented
	- Also can set a width and height for the current scene being drawn, in gamestates it's the map w/h in menu statues it can be specified as desired. The scene will be centered on screen
	- New math functions available for converting vectors and rects to and from scene space
	- Would like to test camera on more cases but it seems good.
	- ISSUE: Resizing window doesn't seem to update the drawing of objects, ie. the scene doesn't recenter which is annoying
		- In addition: Resizing window while playing a gamestate and then trying to quit causes a crash
