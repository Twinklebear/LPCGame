# Working on a C++ tile based 'engine' using SDL

### Todo:
- State Manager is looking good, state system seems to be running well
- Implement moving camera to follow player
- Simple map editor

### Done:
- State's Run() function now returns a string corresponding to the state that should be loaded next, 'quit' specifies that the program should exit completely. ObjectButtons can register a callback SetExit(std::string) for the class's function, which when called will exit Run() and return the desired string as the return code.
- GameObjects now have Save and Load functions, along with States. Save returns a Json::Value containing the information about the object, whereas Load will take a Json::Value and setup the appropriate configuration. I have yet to write load
- States are now loaded from file when needed, saved when they exit, deleted from the statemanager and a new state is loaded, only one state is tracked by the StateManager at a time instead of the vector like before, because they're loaded from file only when they're needed.
